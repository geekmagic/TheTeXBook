\beginchapter Appendix C. 字符编码

%\ninepoint
%Different computers tend to have different ways of representing the
%characters in files of text, but \TeX\ gives the same results on
%all machines, because it converts everything to a standard internal
%code when it reads a file. \TeX\ also converts back from its internal
%representation to the appropriate external code, when it writes
%a file of text; therefore most users need not be aware of the fact
%that the ^{codes} have actually switched back and forth inside the machine.
\ninepoint
不同的计算机往往用不同的方式表示文本文件的字符，
但 \TeX\ 在所有机器上都给出相同的结果，
因为它在读取文件时将所有东西都转换为标准的内部编码。
而 \TeX\ 在写入文本文件时也将内部编码转回恰当的外部编码；
因此大多数用户不会意识到实际上字符^{编码}在机器中来回转换过。

%The purpose of this appendix is to define \TeX's internal code,
%which has the same characteristics on all implementations of \TeX.
%The existence of such a code is important, because it
%makes \TeX\ constructions ``portable.'' For example, \TeX\ allows
%^{alphabetic constants} like |`b| to be used as numbers; the fact
%that |`b| always denotes the integer~98 means that we can
%write machine-independent macros that decide, for instance, whether
%a given character is a digit between |0| and |9|.
%Furthermore the internal code of \TeX\ also survives in its ^|dvi|
%output files, which can be printed by software that knows nothing
%about where the |dvi| data originated; essentially the same
%output will be obtained from all implementations of \TeX, regardless
%of the host computer, because the |dvi| data is expressed in a
%machine-independent code.
这个附录的目的是定义 \TeX\ 的内部编码，它在所有 \TeX\ 实现中都是一致的。
这种编码的存在性是重要的，因为它使得 \TeX\ 是``可移植的''。
例如，\TeX\ 允许将类似 |`b| 的^{字母表常数}作为整数使用；
|`b| 永远表示整数~98 意味着我们可以编写机器无关的宏，
用于确定给定的字符是否为一个在 |0| 和 |9| 之间的数字。
此外，\TeX\ 的内部编码还用于它的 ^|dvi| 输出文件；
打印 |dvi| 文件的软件不知道其数据来自哪里，
但在任何主机的 \TeX\ 实现中将得到完全相同的输出，
因为 |dvi| 数据是用机器无关的编码表示的。

%\smallskip
%\TeX's internal code is based on the American Standard Code for
%Information Interchange, known popularly as ``^{ASCII}.'' There are
%128 codes, numbered 0~to~127; we conventionally express the numbers
%in octal notation, from \oct{000} to \oct{177}, or in
%hexadecimal notation, from \hex{00} to \hex{7F}. Thus, the value of
%|`b| is normally called \oct{142} or \hex{62}, not 98. In the
%ASCII scheme, codes \oct{000} through \oct{040} and
%code \oct{177} are~assigned to special functions; for example,
%code \oct{007} is called |BEL|, and it means ``Ring the bell.''
%The other 94 codes are assigned to visible symbols. Here is a
%chart that shows ASCII codes in such a way that octal and hexadecimal
%equivalents can easily be read off:
\smallskip
\TeX\ 的内部编码基于``^{ASCII}''（American Standard Code for
Information Interchange）。其中一共有 128 个代码，以 0~到~127 编号；
习惯上对这些数字我们用 \oct{000} 到 \oct{177} 的八进制表示，
或者用 \hex{00} 到 \hex{7F} 的十六进制表示。
因此，|`b| 的值通常被称为 \oct{142} 或 \hex{62}，而不是 98。
在 ASCII 体制中，从 \oct{000} 到 \oct{040} 以及 \oct{177}
的代码分配给特殊功能；例如，编码 \oct{007} 称为 |BEL|，
它的意思为 ``Ring the bell''。另外 94 个代码分配给可见符号。
这里有个图表显示了 ASCII 编码，在其中很容易看出八进制和十六进制的对应：

%Ever since ASCII was established in the early 1960s, people have had
%different ideas about what to do with positions \oct{000}--\oct{037} and
%\oct{177}, because most of the functions assigned to those codes are
%appropriate only for special purposes like file transmission, not for
%applications to printing or to interactive computing. It turned out that
%manufacturers soon started producing line printers that were capable of
%generating 128 characters, 33~of~which were tailored to the special needs
%of particular customers; part of the advantage of a standard code was
%therefore lost. On the other hand, the remaining 95~codes (including
%\oct{40}=|SP|, a blank space) have become widely adopted, and they are now
%implanted within most of today's computer terminals. When an ASCII
%keyboard is available, you can specify each of the 128 codes to \TeX\ in
%terms of the 95 standard characters, as follows:
自从 1960 年代 ASCII 建立之后，
人们对如何对待位置 \oct{000}--\oct{037} 和 \oct{177} 有不同的想法，
因为这些编码对应的功能仅在文件传输等特殊目的中才用得到，在打印或者交互计算中用不到。
结果是制造商很快就开始生产可以生成 128 个字符的行式打印机，
其中的 33 个字符被按照特定客户的特别需求而定制；标准编码因此丢失了部分优势。
另一方面，剩下的 95 个编码（包括 \oct{40}=|SP|，即空格）被广泛采用，
并在今天的大多数计算机终端中扎根。在有 ASCII 键盘可用时，
你可以用 95 个标准字符给 \TeX\ 指定 128 个编码中任何一个，方法如下：

%(Here `|^^|' ^^{uparrow uparrow} doesn't necessarily mean two
%circumflex characters; it means two identical characters whose
%current |\catcode| is~7. In such cases \TeX\ simply adds or
%subtracts \oct{100} from the internal code of the character
%that immediately follows. For example, |*|~can also be typed as |^^j|;
%|j|~can also be typed as |^^*|.)
（这里的 `|^^|' ^^{uparrow uparrow} 并不一定非得是两个扬抑符；
两个当前 |\catcode| 为~7 的字符也可以。
在这种用法中，\TeX\ 就将后面跟随的字符的内部编码加上或减去 \oct{100}。
例如，输入 |^^j| 可以得到 |*|；而输入 |^^*| 可以得到|j|。）

%An extended ASCII code intended for text editing and interactive computing
% was developed at several universities about 1965, and
%for many years there have been terminals in use at Stanford, MIT,
%Carnegie-Mellon, and elsewhere that have 120 or~121 symbols, not just~95.
%Aficionados of these keyboards (like the author of this book)
%are loath to give up their extra characters; it seems that
%such people make heavy use of about 5~of the extra~25, and occasional
%use of the other~20, although
%different people have different groups of five. For example, the
%author developed \TeX\ on a keyboard that includes the symbols
%{\tentex\char'30},~{\tentex\char1}, {\tentex\char'32}, {\tentex\char'34},
%and~{\tentex\char'35}, and he finds that this makes it much more pleasant
%to type class notes,
%technical papers, and computer programs of the kind he likes to write;
%his logician friends make heavy use of the {\tentex\char'24} and
%{\tentex\char'25} keys; and so on. It is recommended that \TeX\
%implementations on systems with large character sets be consistent with the
%following codes:
%\beginchart{\tentex\postdisplaypenalty=0}
%\normalchart
%\endchart
%Of course, designers of \TeX\ macro packages that are intended to be
%widely used should stick to the standard ASCII characters.
在 1965 年左右，有些大学开发了一个面向文本编辑和交互计算的扩展 ASCII 编码，
而在 Stanford、MIT、Carnegie-Mellon 和其他大学使用多年的一种终端有
120 或 121 个符号，不仅仅是 95 个。
这些键盘的爱好者（如本书作者）不愿意放弃他们的附加字符；
看起来这些人经常使用这 25 个补充字符的其中 5 个，而偶尔使用另外 20 个，
虽然常使用的 5 个字符对不同人来说是不同的。
例如，作者在一个包含符号 {\tentex\char'30}、{\tentex\char1}、{\tentex\char'32}、
{\tentex\char'34} 和 {\tentex\char'35} 的键盘上开发 \TeX ，
他发现这可以更加愉快地输入课程笔记、技术论文以及他喜欢编写的那些计算机程序；
而他的逻辑学朋友经常使用 {\tentex\char'24} 和 {\tentex\char'25} 按键；等等。
建议在拥有大字符集的系统上的 \TeX\ 实现与下面的编码保持一致：

当然，面向广大用户的 \TeX\ 宏包的设计者应当只使用标准的 ASCII 字符。

%Incidentally, the ASCII character |^| that appears in position \oct{136}
%is sometimes called a ``^{caret},'' but dictionaries of English tell us
%that a caret is a larger symbol, more like character \oct{004} in the
%extended set above. The correct name for |^| is ``^{circumflex},'' but
%this is quite a mouthful, so a shorter name like ``^{hat}'' is preferable.
%It seems desirable to preserve the traditional distinction between
%caret and hat.

%The extended code shown above was developed at MIT; it is similar to, but

%are conventionally assigned to the standard ASCII control functions
%|NUL| (^\<null>), |HT| (^\<tab>), |LF| (^\<linefeed>), |FF|

%|DEL| (^\<delete>), and they appear in the standard ASCII positions; hence the
%corresponding seven characters
%{\tentex\char0~\char'11~\char'12~\char'14~\char'15~\char'33~\char'177}
%do not actually appear on the keyboard. These seven ``hidden''
%characters show up only on certain output devices.

%differ in which characters they will accept in input files and which
%they will transmit to output files; these subsets can be specified
%independently. A completely permissive version of \TeX\ allows full
%256-character input and output; other versions might ignore all
%but the visible characters of ASCII; still other versions might
%distinguish the tab character (code \oct{011}) from a space on input,
%but might output each tab as a sequence of three characters |^^I|.

%Many people, unfortunately, have the opposite problem:\ Instead of the
%95~standard characters and some others, they have fewer than~95 symbols
%actually available. What can be done in such cases? Well, it's possible
%to use \TeX\ with fewer symbols, by invoking more control
%sequences; for example, plain \TeX\ defines ^|\lq|, ^|\rq|, ^|\lbrack|,
%^|\rbrack|, ^|\sp|, and ^|\sb|, so that you need not type |`|,~|'|, |[|, |]|,
%|^|, and~|_|, respectively.
