\beginchapter Appendix A. 练习答案

The preface to this manual points out the wisdom of trying to figure out
each exercise before you look up the answer here. But these answers are intended
to be read, since they occasionally provide additional information that
you are best equipped to understand when you have just worked on a problem.

If you can't solve a problem,
you can always look up the answer.
But please, try first to solve it by yourself;
then you'll learn more and you'll learn faster.
