Dear Prof.~Reid:

I understand that you are having difficulties with
Alka-Seltzer tablets.
Since there are 25~pills
per bottle, while the manufacturer's directions
recommend ``plop,~plop, fizz,~fizz,'' my colleagues
tell me that you have accumulated a substantial
number of bottles in which there is one tablet
left. % (See the 1978 SCRIBE User Manual, page 90.)

At present I am engaged in research on the potential
applications of isolated analgesics. If you would
be so kind as to donate your Alka-Seltzer collection
to our project, I would be more than happy to send
you preprints of any progress reports that we may
publish concerning this critical problem.

\closing
Sincerely,
R. J. Drofnats
Professor

P. S. \ If you like, I will check into the
possibility that your donation and the meals that
you have been eating might be tax-deductible, in
connection with our research.
